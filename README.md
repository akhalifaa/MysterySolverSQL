#### The problem given was that a theft occured on a certain date and street name that were provided to me. Given was a database file with 10 tables of varying columns related to the different aspects of the crime.
#### For example, some of the tables given were: suspect interviews, flights out of the city, ATM transactions, security footage and more...
#### The goal was to strategically navigate all the tables and join them in order to figure out the thief, accomplice and city of escape.
#### The way I tackled this task was through a series of queries as seen in my log.sql file, all queries are titled with a common and are run one query at a time. Query by query I was able to determine the relevant columns to look at and narrow down the data to obtain the solution. Every q.text file has the result of my subsequent queries.
